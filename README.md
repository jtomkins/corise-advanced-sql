**Virtual Kitchen**

Our exercises will use data from a fictional company called Virtual Kitchen, an interactive meal-delivery service. Virtual Kitchen currently operates in the United States. We need to use the city and state in order to identify the locations of our customers and suppliers.

Virtual Kitchen has three types of users:

Chefs: Chefs upload their favorite recipes and then receive points each time a customer orders one of their recipes.

Customers: Customers order from recipes in the database, and the ingredients for each recipe are shipped to their address.

Suppliers: Suppliers package the ingredients for the recipes and ship them to customers.
